# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `CONSTRAINT_ERROR` exception.  This exception is raised when an attempt is made to assign a value to a variable that is outside the range defined for its subtype.

The `bug.ada` file contains the code that causes the error. The `bugSolution.ada` file offers a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of range checking and careful attention to subtype constraints in Ada programming to avoid runtime errors.
